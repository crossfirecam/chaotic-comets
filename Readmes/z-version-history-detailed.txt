Chaotic Comets Detailed Version History

------------------
Version 1.4 Detailed Changelog (2021-04-20)
------------------
Shop Changes
- The previous shop is no more. New shop has eight upgrades and two consumable purchases.
    - Defence Upgrades: Shield Strength, Teleport Rate
    - Evasion Upgrades: Ship Speed, Brake Power
    - Weapons Upgrades: Auto Firerate, Shot Limit, Shot Speed, Shot Range
    - Maintenance: Charge Shields, Buy Extra Ship
- Each upgrade has its own purchase panel with a description and upgrade progress.
    - Shield Strength and Shot Limit are premium upgrades, significantly improving the ship for more cost.
    - All the other upgrades increase the base stat by 20% per tier, cheaper to start upgrading.

Difficulty Changes
- Difficulties scale how fast the asteroids will move, and the stats of UFO's.
    - It also increases base chance for UFO's to appear, and reduces bullet deviation of their shots.
- Auto-Brake nerf for Hard mode removed.
- Insane mode added. Makes ship weaker, further speeds up asteroids, and halves the spawnrate of canisters.

Player Changes
- When respawning or starting a level, teleport meter is now set to 0.
    - The player doesn't collide with objects and fades away faster while Teleport-Out sequence is playing.
    - Asteroids that touch the player will be destroyed while the Teleport-In sequence is playing.
    - When teleport is ready, a visual indicator and sound are played. If it's not ready, an error sound plays.
- Manual and automatic shots have different cooldowns. This allows the player to fire quickly by pressing Fire repeatedly. To balance this, the shot amount on-screen is limited to 2. Upgradable in shop.
    - Triple Fire can take advantage of quick fire. Rapid Fire still has an unskippable long cooldown.
- Ship takes more damage from impacts. Asteroids bounce the player less, leading to more hits from big asteroids.
- Base bullet range is decreased. As a result range upgrades are less overpowered.
    - Far Shot now also increases shot speed (including upgrades) by 40%.

Gameplay Changes
- Players are given a credit bonus depending how long it takes them to complete an area. This bonus starting point increases the more asteroids there are. Each level gets a bonus that's between 60 to 120 seconds.
- Both players in 2P mode share a life counter. The player who dies on 0 Ships can choose to respawn when the remaining player picks up a spare Ship.
    - Bonus ships now take 10,000 total credits to obtain. Spare ships can be purchased in the Shop for 5,000c.
- Multi-colour asteroids mode added to Options. Changes asteroids to random colours.

UFO Changes
- Green Class UFO is less annoying. They stop further away from ships, are less common, and teleport away when a player dies.
- Green Class UFO is now faster during chase animation. They'll target the player closest when they spawn.
- Red Class UFO can now spawn on either side. Red Class is slightly smaller, less health, slower travelling.
- Both UFO's have different sounds now, and have a 'panic' and 'dying' tracking sound effect.
- Both UFO's have shot deviation that throw off shots a bit, but in general are more dangerous.
- Both UFO's appear in all levels, but have a cap. This cap will continue to increase, instead of stopping at 3.

Canister, Asteroid Changes
- Canisters only appear in 70% of levels. Very rarely they will be replaced by 6 canisters at once!
- Asteroids have a hard cap of 15 on screen at once. Base amount of asteroids per level takes longer to increase.
